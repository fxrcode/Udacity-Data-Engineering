# Data Modeling with Postgres

## Project Directions

## Local environment setup
* I use docker-compose to launch postgres, and cassandra.

## Datasets
* due to jupyter lab's whatever limit, I can't download data folder from workspace.
* as Himanshu's answer in: https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/300378#300404, simply did `zip -r output.zip data`. So I can download this zip file.
* however, right click on the file shows chrome menu rather jupyterlab menu, as suggested in SOF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54915250/clicking-does-not-work-in-jupyterlab-os-x-chrome, it's due to extension: `Right-to-Copy`. I disabled it and right clicks works now!
